# pavement-patch-and-nonslip-detection
We provide the code for training and testing pavement patch and nonslip detection using MMDetection and MMYOLO. We also deploy Web-base using Flask

1. For using web_base flask:
    The patching detection model name: best.pt
    However, it is bigger than 25 MB, so cannot upload directly on Github.
    Please use the below link and download and then put model into pytorch detection folder
